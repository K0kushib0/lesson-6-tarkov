                    Following Reshala around are 4 heavily armed guards. These guards will typically carry modded AK's loaded with various ammo types including tracer ammunition, tier 2-6 Armor vests, and tier 3-5 helmets that sometimes have visors. Unlike regular scavs, these guards are highly aggressive and will frequently push towards the player instead of taking cover. The followers all have the last name Zavodskoy.

                <h2>Strategy</h2>
                <p class="strategy">
                    To kill Reshala first, the best tactic is to find him before being seen. He can be easily identified by his brown sweater, unlike his followers who wear blue jackets with white striped cuffs. After being spotted he will run behind his guards, forcing you to kill them first. Before spending time looting Reshala or his guards it's recommended that you kill all five of them as they will usually stay within close proximity to each other and will kill you while looting. The guards are very aggressive compared to normal scavs and will rush the player. When facing these guards be aware of their positions so you do not get caught off guard when they run up to you. Since the guards are frequently in close proximity to each other, grenades can be highly effective at stunning or killing multiple of them at once. This is especially effective for when Reshala and his guards spawn at dorms. However, be aware that they also have grenades and will throw both flashbangs and fragmentation grenades at you, even when you're out of their line of sight and hidden behind cover.

                    Killa is a loner, and does not tolerate strangers on her territory.

                <h2>Strategy</h2>
                <p class="strategy">
                    It is recommended to avoid being spotted by Killa. He has multiple grenades and is generally accurate with his bursts. If you are close to him he will continuously push the player and relentlessly hunt them until he ambushes and assaults them. It is best to attack him with high-penetration ammunition such as 5.45 BS, 5.56 M995, or 7.62x51. Without proper ammunition to kill him, shredding his 6B13 M to low durability or firing solely at his legs are both appropriate, albeit more risky, strategies. Grenades generally won't work to kill him, as he is a highly mobile fighter and will rarely be pinned down long enough for a grenade to stop him. If fighting him with a teammate, attacking him from two different directions and peeking cover is a sound strategy, as he will continue to suppress one of his opponents while the other can safely return fire.

                    Their weapons alternate between various semi-automatic rifles and an occasional VSS, and also have class 3 -> class 6 Armor vests. Each rifle is loaded with ammo that is ideal for shredding all types of armor, so one should beware of staying out in the open for too long.

                <h2>Strategy</h2>
                <p class="strategy">
                    It is recommended that the player(s) take the initiative when engaging the Boss. As the boss and his guards are often spread out, it is best to first recon the area and figure out where they are, then eliminate one of them, preferably the boss, with a single, well-placed headshot with more than 62 flesh damage, anything lower than 62 will take 2 headshots to kill. As neither the boss nor his guards wear helmets, headshots are the best way to go, given that guards are often decently armored and the boss has high chest health.
